# JPG-to-PNG-Converter
A program that converts all the .jpg files into .png files.
Just give it a folder of files that needs to be converted (with a backslah following it) and the destination folder (bakslash following it) in which .png files need to be stored.
Not mandatory that the destination folder should exist.
